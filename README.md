# My Scheme

This is an interpreter for a subset of the R5RS scheme. It is reasonably complete, but missing a few key things like macros and is intended for learning only.
It can also be compiled to wasm to allow interpreting scheme expressions on a webpage.

Many of the things I learned here are present in the [Rusp](https://github.com/strinsberg/rusp) project.
